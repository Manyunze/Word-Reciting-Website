#### 3.2 Run locally from source code
###### 3.2.1 Activate virtual environment venv
venv is not included because of its size
Basically, you need:

- Database MySQL
###### 3.2.2 Install Prerequisit
> _mysql database client_: Default is mysqlclient
###### 3.2.3 Change setting file
Inside `mysite/settings.py`
```python
    DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'django_bs',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': '123456',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',  # Empty for localhost through domain sockets or '127.0.0.1' for localhost through TCP.
        'PORT': '3306',       # Set to empty string for default.
    }
}
```
- change `NAME` into the name of database in MySQL
